              Reading: I enjoy exploring books and articles on product
              leadership, personal growth, and history. Reading helps me see the
              world from different perspectives.

              Singing: Singing is one of my favourite ways to express myself. It
              lifts my mood, keeps me creative, and helps me connect emotionally

            One of my aspirations is to become a global innovation leader who
            not only builds impactful solutions but also inspires and mentors
            the next generation of African innovators. I want my journey to show
            that with vision and consistency, you can create lasting change.
